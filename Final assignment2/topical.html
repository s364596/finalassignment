                <h2>An example of innovation during the rapid digitalization in response <br>
                    to the corona crisis and why it can be labled as an innovation </h2>
                <p>
                One innovation as a response to the corona crisis is the use of 
                 <abbr title="Quick Response"> QR </abbr> codes in restaurants and bars. 
                Scanning the <abbr title="Quick Response"> QR </abbr> code directs you to a website where you can register your stay, view, and order from the menu.
                Then, you can pick up your order at the bar, or a waiter delivers it to your table.
                We definitely feel like this use of <abbr title="Quick Response"> QR </abbr> codes can be classified as innovation.
                That’s because although <abbr title="Quick Response"> QR </abbr> codes is an existing technology, 
                this implementation together with an online menu and an ordering system (e.g., Favrit, previously Ordr <a href="https://favrit.com" target="_blank">(https://favrit.com)</a>) is quite innovative. 
                During the pandemic, this solution can be viewed as useful, it causes less contact between people and less contact with physical menus. 
                It makes ordering simpler, more flexible, and often faster. One downside is the lack of in-person contact between the staff and the costumers. 
                It makes it more difficult to ask questions about the menu and less of an opportunity for good customer service. 
                This technology is not completely new, but this use of it is new and much more widespread now than it was before. 
                Right before the pandemic the use of <abbr title="Quick Response"> QR </abbr> codes was in decline <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2021/03/25/how-the-pandemic-saved-the-qr-code-from-extinction/?sh=21d48a846905" target="_blank">(Gostin, 2021)</a>. 
                It’s a good example of how the corona crisis has forced us to think differently and basically redefine what a visit to a restaurant should entail.

                <h3>A non yet existing job that might appear in the future</h3>
                <p>
                During our discussion of this topic we were imagining the job of watching over or nannying an <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr>. 
                This <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> could be doing tasks previously performed by humans, perhaps managing use of recourses in a hospital, monitoring, or even controlling public transport like trains. 
                The human’s job would in this case be to guide the <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> to the right decisions and have the final say in any case where the <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> is not sure about its decisions. 
                The &ldquo;nanny&rdquo; would together with the <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> form a team that could perform jobs more precisely and more efficient than humans or <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> alone. 
                As artificial intelligence is becoming more utilized as a part of modern technological solutions questions have been raised about the morality of artificial intelligence <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/10/ethical-concerns-mount-as-ai-takes-bigger-decision-making-role/">(Pazzanese, 2020)</a>.
                The nanny would also act as a moral compass and help guide the <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> in situations where human judgement and a sense of morality is needed. 
                Even in the field of software development new technology has enabled the use of artificial intelligence to write software based on semantic descriptions <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank"> (GitHub Inc, 2021)</a>. 
                Even if this kind of technology could write fully functioning software free of software bugs, it’s hard to imagine its use without human oversight and intervention. 
                As a group we all agree that we would feel more comfortable with humans being involved in most systems that affect our lives. Be it decisions about our health or our transportation needs. 
                We talked about sci-fi movies where artificial intelligence got out of control and agree that the possibility of human intervention is a good idea all places where <abbr title="artificial intelligence"> AI </abbr> is being utilized to manage systems in real-time. 
                Whether we would like to have this kind of job is uncertain.
