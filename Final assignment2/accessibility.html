               <h1>How our group checked our sites accessibility</h1>
               <p>
                In two of our subjects, web development and technology and society, we have learned how important it is for tech to have an inclusive design.
                Technology is something that should be accessible to everyone. 
                Therefore, while designing our site, we kept in mind <em>struggles people with different handicaps could potentially have</em>. 
            </p> 
                
                <p>
                For example, bad eyesight. 
                Bad eyesight makes it difficult for people to read, especially if the text size is very small. 
                In addition, the font itself plays an important part in whether or not something is easily readable.  
            </p>

                <p>
                People that are colourblind can also struggle on the internet. 
                If the colour of the text and the background blend together, it can also become difficult to read the text on the site.  
                To ensure that our website was accessible, we ran it through an automated test which evaluates web page design, content, and structure that identifies usual occurring problems according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank"> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. 
                We used a website called <a href="https://www.deque.com/free-accessibility-test/" target="_blank"> Deque</a>, that does exactly this.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, we also found tips on the internet that would help us shape our website for the visually impaired: 
            </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Providing sufficient contrasts on the site using the right colours and textures</li>
                <li>Limit how many different colours we use </li>
                <li>Allowing for manual font size adjusments </li>
                <li>Using descriptive labels for the buttons on the site </li>
                <li>Organizing the page content using headers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                Last but not least, we put our website through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank"> W3C Markup Validation Service </a> to check just if the code itself is correct.
