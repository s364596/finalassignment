               <h1>Our Experience</h1>
               <p>
                The transition from upper-secondary school, or work life, to university can seem both exciting and scary at the same time. 
                The life of a student is very different compared to being a pupil in a lot of different aspects. 
                In this essay we will be looking at our biggest challenges we encountered when adjusting for university.  

                In our group we have people that went to university straight from upper-secondary school, military service, and work life. 
                Therefore, we discussed the topic, and we will focus on the similarities we faced in terms of obstacles.  
               </p>
                 
                <h2>Class and teachers</h2> 
                
                <p>
                <em>One of the biggest differences from secondary school is the class and the relationship you as a student have with the professors.</em>
                Through primary school, high school, and upper-secondary school you build a strong intimacy between the other students and with the teachers. 
                However, in university it’s not quite the same. 
                It becomes hard for one professor to build a strong relationship with 500 different students when you barely even see them. 
                
                What we were even more surprised to see is the combination of professors and <abbr title="Teacher Assistant">TAs</abbr>. 
                <abbr title="Teacher Assistant">TAs</abbr>, short for teacher assistant, play an important role in our classes. 
                <abbr title="Teacher Assistant">TAs</abbr> are voluntary students that we students at <abbr title="Oslo Metropolitan University">OsloMet</abbr> go to for questions. 
                Sometimes, they even hold the classes for the professors and check up on our work. 
                One of the first things we learned was that if we have any questions, we first check the forums on Canvas. 
                Then, if we still don’t have the answers, we can ask the <abbr title="Teacher Assistant">TAs</abbr>. If you haven’t gotten a good enough answer from the <abbr title="Teacher Assistant">TAs</abbr>, then you can ask the professor.  
                
                While you can still make strong bonds with a group of the class, you most likely will not be able to interact with everyone. 
                Like we mentioned earlier, there are a lot of people in each class. 
                Some students in the same class as you, might also study towards different from yourself. 
                For example, in the first year all students that study <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>, applied computer science and computer engineering all have discrete mathematics as a subject. 
                Not being in a class of max 30 people, where you spend many hours together, across many years is quite unusual.  
                </p>
                 
                
                <h3>Self-study</h3> 
                <p>
                To apply to a university, you first need general study competence from upper-secondary school, and other requirements the study program may have. 
                Throughout your schooling you should have learned about different study method and doing it on your own without anyone telling you how. 
                This comes to the test in university. It becomes crucial to manage your workloud in a way that is effective. 
                It is super important to stay ahead of time so you don’t <del>shit</del> do bad on your exams. 
                Independently working with school and the subjects that you have. 
                University is a place of freedom, and nobody is going to care if you don’t do &ldquo;homwork&rdquo;. 
                It is your job to make sure that you have been learning everything you need from the curriculum.  
                In upper-secondary just being in the classroom during class was enough to do well on your test. 
                However, <strong> in university it becomes a necessity to work at home practicing </strong>, with for example coding.
